# ComfyUI

ComfyUI is an open-source, node-based interface for Stable Diffusion and other generative-AI models.
Other than most interfaces for generating images, it exposes the underlying pipeline of componants that make image-generation possible. Due to it's flexible node-interface it enables recomposition of existing models and architectures.
